# CLAUDE.md

This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

## Project Overview

This is a data science project repository focused on DataQuest coursework. The main content consists of Jupyter notebooks that are processed with Quarto to generate HTML and PDF outputs.

## Development Commands

### Rendering Documents
- `quarto render DataQuest_DataScientist/01.ipynb` - Render a specific notebook to HTML
- `quarto preview DataQuest_DataScientist/01.ipynb` - Render and preview with live reload
- `quarto render` - Render all documents in the project

### Working with Notebooks
- `jupyter notebook` or `jupyter lab` - Launch Jupyter interface for editing notebooks
- Use Python 3 kernel (python3 command available at `/usr/bin/python3`)

## Project Structure

The repository follows a simple structure:
- `DataQuest_DataScientist/` - Contains course materials and notebooks
  - `01.ipynb` - Quarto-enabled Jupyter notebook with YAML frontmatter
  - `01.html` - Rendered HTML output from Quarto
  - `01.pdf` - PDF output
  - `01_files/` - Supporting assets (CSS, JS libraries) generated by Quarto

## Key Technologies

- **Quarto**: Document publishing system that renders Jupyter notebooks to multiple formats
- **Jupyter**: Interactive notebook environment for Python data science work
- **Python 3**: Primary programming language (available as `python3`)

## Workflow Notes

Notebooks use Quarto YAML frontmatter for configuration and are designed to be rendered to both HTML and PDF formats. The notebooks contain Python code for data science exercises and learning materials.

## Environments

- Python version 3.9.6
- Updated to Python version 3.12 for Jupyter compatibility
